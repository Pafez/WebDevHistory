Web 1.0, or the "static web," is a term used to describe the earliest era of the internet, from the 1990s to the early 2000s. It was a mainly read-only medium, where users would see the information but there was minimal interaction. Sites were static html pages that often were designed with simple layouts and only a little bit of multimedia content. These pages were created using tools such as HTML, CSS, and also basic scripting languages such as JavaScript. Search engines such as Yahoo! and directories were the main tools that users used for navigation in this web era. The only way the user could interact with the site was by performing actions such as clicking links or filling in simple forms.


Web 2.0, which appeared in the mid-2000s, transferred the internet to a space of "read-write," and thus centered on the contribution and interactivity of the users. Facebook, YouTube, and Wikipedia were the platforms that users could create, share, and collaborate on the web. The webpage was dynamic, the interaction was in real-time, and APIs for service integration were some of the key elements. With the use of JavaScript frameworks (such as jQuery and AngularJS), HTML5, and CSS3, website experiences became richer. This period was characterized by social media, blogs, and cloud-based tools, thus the web became more participatory and community-focused.


Web 3.0, or the semantic web, is the next phase in the evolution of the internet towards a decentralized, super-intelligent internet. This is done through the use of personalization, blockchain-based decentralization, and artificial intelligence to help users become better at what they do. The main characteristics of this include the use of smart contracts, cryptocurrency integration, and the semantic data organization that allows machines to "understand" content. Platforms such as blockchain (Ethereum, Polkadot), AI frameworks, and decentralized storage systems (IPFS) are the core technologies for Web 3.0. Decentralized applications (dApps) and NFTs are the applications of this phase that focus on user ownership and security.
